            <h3>5. Bleach Live-action on Netflix</h3>
                <p>It was really only the first 2 or 3 episodes squashed together in a movie. 3/10.</p>
            <h3>4. The Butterfly Effect</h3>
                <p>A little confusing, but still quite cool. 6/10.</p>
            <h3>3. Avatar 1</h3>
                <p>Amazing. The CGI was incredible and the storyline even better. 8.5/10.</p>
            <h3>2. Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
                <p>Loved the story, characters were well thought out and it really tied into the emotional factor. 9/10.</p>
            <h3>1. Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
                <p>Brilliant movie, the more cartoony feel was amazing and every character was beautifully unique. 10/10.</p>
